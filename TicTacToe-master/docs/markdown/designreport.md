# **Design report**

We are making a game called TicTacToe. We followed a few programming rules throughout the project and they are explained below. Our main goal was to have the game as simple as possible. We stored all our code base on a private repository on GitHub from the beginning and we used automatic build process that run all unit tests. As members in our group lived in several places we used Google Hangouts and Teamspeak to communicate through the internet. They support group chats and screen sharing, which we used a lot. We also used Automated Continuous Integration Server (Travis). Documentation was written with Markdown.

### Programming rules
Programming style is a set of rules or guidelines used when writing the source code for a
computer program. Each group member wrote down his idea of the programming rules he
thought were in the best interests of the group. When everyone got together, the group voted
on the best programming rules and decided the rules that everybody agreed upon. These are
the rules that we will follow when we will be writing the code for the game. Having these
rules will help us and other programmers to read and understand the code and to help avoid
possible errors.

### Java rules

- Variable names must be mixed cased starting with lower case.
- Names representing methods must be verbs and written mixed cased starting with lower case.
- All names should be written in English.
- Plural form should be used on names representing a collection of object.

### Operating and development environment

**GitHub**  is a web based version of Git repository hosting service. It offers all of the distribution revision control and source code management functionality of G it as well as adding its own features. 

**Google Docs**  is a web based word processor. We made our reports with this tool, which made all group members able to work on them at the same time.

**Google Hangouts**  is a unified communications service that allows members to initiate and participate in text, voice or video chats, either one-on-one or in a group.

**TeamSpeak** is proprietary voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) software that allows computer users to speak on a chat channel with fellow computer users, much like a telephone conference call.

**Sublime Text** is a cross-platform source code editor with a Python application programming interface (API).
